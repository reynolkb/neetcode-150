# Product of Array Except Self

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:\
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`\
Output: `[24,12,8,6]`

Example 2:\
Input: `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`\
Output: `[0,0,9,0,0]`

## Run Command
`poetry run python "1. Arrays & Hashing/6. Product of Array Except Self/product_of_array_except_self.py"`
